    "# What are encodings?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Character encodings** are specific sets of rules for mapping from raw binary byte strings (that look like this: 0110100001101001) to characters that make up human-readable text (like \"hi\"). There are many different encodings, and if you tried to read in text with a different encoding than the one it was originally written in, you ended up with scrambled text called \"mojibake\" (said like mo-gee-bah-kay). Here's an example of mojibake:\n",
    "\n",
    "æ–‡å—åŒ–ã??\n",
    "\n",
    "You might also end up with a \"unknown\" characters. There are what gets printed when there's no mapping between a particular byte and a character in the encoding you're using to read your byte string in and they look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "����������\n",
    "\n",
    "Character encoding mismatches are less common today than they used to be, but it's definitely still a problem. There are lots of different character encodings, but the main one you need to know is UTF-8.\n",
    "\n",
    "> UTF-8 is **the** standard text encoding. All Python code is in UTF-8 and, ideally, all your data should be as well. It's when things aren't in UTF-8 that you run into trouble.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was pretty hard to deal with encodings in Python 2, but thankfully in Python 3 it's a lot simpler. (Kaggle Notebooks only use Python 3.) There are two main data types you'll encounter when working with text in Python 3. One is is the string, which is what text is by default."
